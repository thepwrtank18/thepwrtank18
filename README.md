# Hello!
## Here are my GitHub stats:
GitHub Stats are disabled as they are heavily out of date.

My favorite language is C#  due to how much you can do with it (and how you don't need to sign in to Oracle to get a JDK).

My love/hate language is Batchfile (Command Prompt code). It's really annoying to make scripts for it, but when you do, you get this giant relief.
